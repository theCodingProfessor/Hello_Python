## Intended Learning Concepts and Outcomes

## Industry and Applied Knowledge
Learn to code in Python, an extremely popular modern programming language.

## Intellectual Enrichment 
Use logic and reasoning in a quantitative problem-solving context.

## Role as a Software Professional 
- Use industry best practices in design, system analysis and coding.

## Core Programming Techniques and Coding Skills 
- Enter/create and run code/programs using a coding editor.
- Apply code debugging and testing techniques.
- Declare and use variables of primitive types, numeric and string 
- Identify data types and related errors. 
- Prompt and save input for numeric and string data into variables
- Compute arithmetic results from variable data 
- Use conditional logic, equality, and logical operators expressions.
- Manipulate string data using conditional logic expressions
- Process and format output data.
- Design and create User Defined functions.
- Demonstrate variable scope in functions and methods.
- Demonstrate pass-by-reference and pass-by-value in a function. 
- Examine and implement repetition using for and while loops.
- Implement nested loops, and code a loop break feature.
- Show error catching and exception handing, and assertions.

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
- Examine and implement object-oriented programming principles.
- Design and create a class, with constructor, data members and methods.
- Declare and use an Object of a class.
- Describe and implement constructor and method parameters and return types.
- Extend a class using overloaded methods
- Extend a class using class inheritance 
- Extend a class using polymorphism

## Data Structures and Computing Topics
- Implement a sort and search on a one-dimensional array.
- Store data as an array, multidimensional arrays, and access data by direction and sequence.
- Store and retrieve data as a simple text file.
- Code/decode byte data, and store and retrieve as a file.
- Use a selection algorithm.
- Use a sorting algorithm.

## Application Design and Software Lifecycle Concepts
- Identify major components of simple and complex programs.
- Identify algorithmic needs in an application. 
- Apply best practices for design documents, doc collections and code repositories.
- Describe program logic using planning tools for `simple-text`, `flowcharts`, `class diagrams`, `pseudocode` and `UML`
- Analyze problems and determine appropriate logic-as-a-code solution.
