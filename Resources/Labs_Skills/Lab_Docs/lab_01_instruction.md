### Lab 1: Hello World

#### Assignment Overview
   - This lab is designed to introduce you to creating and running a simple Python script. You will create a Python file, add metadata, implement a basic print statement, and ensure your code runs correctly.

#### Learning Objectives
   - Learn to create and name a Python file.
   - Understand how to add metadata to your Python scripts.
   - Implement and run a basic print statement in Python.
   - Practice debugging and resolving basic issues.

#### Instructions
A single blank line MUST be at the bottom of a .py source code file.

**1.1. Create File**
- Use your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to create a new Python file named `hello_world.py`.

**1.2. Add Metadata (header/comments)**
- At the top of your Python file, include the following comments:

```python
"""
Module Name: Programming Lab 1
Description: Source Code File (i.e. A Module)
Author: Your Name
Date: Formatted
Filename: hello_world.py 
"""

```

**1.3. Implement Code**
- Below the metadata comments, write the following code to print "Hello World":
```python
print(f'Hello World')
```

**1.4. Run Your Script**
- Execute the script in your IDE to ensure that "Hello World" is printed to the screen.
- Ensure there is a single blank line after the metadata and the print statement.
- Ensure there is a single blank line at the end of the source code file.
- Make sure there are no syntax errors, warnings, or issues (such as extra whitespace or spaces between the `print` function and the parentheses).

**1.5. Resolve Issues, Warnings, and Errors**
- If there are any issues, debug and resolve them to ensure your script runs correctly and adheres to the formatting guidelines.

#### Submission
   - A Python module. A source code file named `hello_world.py` 

#### Assessment Criteria
   - Proper file naming and adherence to instructions.
   - Correct implementation of the print statement.
   - Accurate and complete comments.
   - Absence of syntax errors, warnings, or formatting issues.

#### Additional Notes
   - Verify your script works as intended before submission. Double-check for any syntax errors or warnings to ensure your code meets the specified requirements.
