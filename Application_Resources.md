# Application Design and Creation  

This section presents four progressively complex Python applications to enhance your skills in design and coding.  

### Requirements  
To get started, you will need a Python editor like **PyCharm** or **VS Code**.
Each assignment includes an instruction sheet and the source code solution.

## Make the Apps Your Own  

These applications provide a guided pathway to creating functional Python projects.
However, the ultimate goal is to inspire you to envision and design applications of your own.  
- Use the provided examples as a foundation to add your unique features or topics.  
- Experiment with new ideas to create entirely custom applications.

## Learn by Typing Code  

The best way to master programming is to write the code yourself, avoid copying and pasting.  
- Use the provided source code as a reference to **retype** the programs.  
- As you code, you will improve your ability to read, understand, and debug.
