## Application Design and Creation

The Python applications (apps) below are listed from simple (top) to more complex (bottom).<br>
You will need a Python editor like PyCharm or VS Code.

Each assignment has an instruction sheet, and then the source code solution.

### Make the App Your Own
Each app in this collection is designed to provide a guaranteed pathway to a simple Python Application (four total). 
While this is helpful, the full intention of these assignments is to inspire you to see that a pathway to the application you envision is also possible. <br><br>
Using the principles outlined in the sample applications, consider adding your topic, feature or idea. Or better yet make the app a design totally of your own.

### Type Your Own Code
The only pathway to skill is to type your own code, or simply put, do not copy and paste.<br><br>
All the code you need is in the Source Code file.
Retype the text to '...learn how to code.' As you type the code in, your skills to read, understand and debug code will emerge.
